        <p style="color:white;"> My name is Nazir Ahmad ZAHIRI. I'm a Master student at Ankara Yıldırım Beyazıt Üniversitesi 
        Computer Engineering Department.
        I was born in Afghanistan Kandahar, Right now I am living in Ankara Turkey.
        <br>
        <br> 
        
        Currently, I am working (remotely) as a freelance <b>Machine learning Engineer</b>. Getting understandings 
        out of data is something that I really like. Data mining, Machine learning and Data visualization
        are some techniques that I am using to achieve this. I prefer to use Python and R for my 
        Everyday work.I have a serious passion for sports and healthy living and I would love to help you out 
        if you have a project in those areas.</p>

          <h2>Book Recommendation System using Machine Learning</h2>
          <br>
          <p>The huge amount of data available on the Internet
            has preceded to the development of recommendation systems.
            In the following project I have proposed the use of soft
            dividing techniques to develop recommendation systems. This
            addresses the limits of current algorithms used to implement book
            recommendation systems. evaluation of experimental results,
            and conclusion. Recommendation systems are a type of info categorizing 
            that is based on first choice of the user. The aim
            of a recommendation system to enhance user knowledge and
            communication with the system to improve traffic and in turn
            boost company income.</p>

          <h2>A Real-Time Video-Based Adaptive Vechicle Detection And Counting System For Urban Roads
            </h2>
            <br>
          <p>In advance countries, many expanding cities are facing challenges that result from the amazing 
            numbers of people and vehicles. Collecting real-time, positive and actual traffic flow information is 
            crucial for urban road traffic authority. The main purpose of this project is to develop an adaptive model 
            that can check the real-time vehicle counts on urban roads using computer vision technologies. This 
            project proposes an automatic real-time background update algorithm for vehicle detection and vehicle 
            counting based on the virtual loop and detection line methods. </p>

          <h2>Fake News Detection Using Machine Learning</h2>
          <br>
          <p>The major objective is to detect the fake news, which is a typical text classification 
             problem with a consecutive further proposition. It is necessary to develop a prototype 
             that can differentiate between “Real” news and “Fake” news.
             Fake news straightforward meaning is to integrate information that directs people
             to the wrong path. These Days fake news is expanding like water and people share this 
             information with no authenticating it. This is frequently done to advance or require 
             specific proposals and is frequently completed with diplomatic programs.  For mass media channels, the power to appeal audiences to their websites is 
             required to produce online marketing proceeds. So, it is essential to detect fake news.</p>

          <h2>Customer Market Segmentation using Unsupervised Machine Learning</h2>
          <br>
          <p>The major objective of this project Customer Segmentation is the process of dividing customers 
            into groups based on common characteristics so companies can market to each group effectively and 
            appropriately. Customers are segmented according to their similarities in behavior and habits.In 
            this project I implemented unsupervised machine learning algorithms: K-means. In collaboration with a 
            delivery company. My goal is to segment their customers given the customer’s various behaviors and features, 
            in order for the company to be able to market for each segment in a manner that is more fitting 
            to each individual customer.</p>

            homepage, all using HTML, CSS and JSAngular on Visual Studio Code .In this project,
            you will be able to identify and apply the basic concepts of HTML, CSS and JSAngular.
            You will efficiently grasp the fundamental meaning of every component , be able to use it and

            Language Processing. It is the process of classifying text strings or
            documents into different categories, depending upon the contents of
            the strings. Text classification has a variety of applications, such as
            detecting user sentiment from a tweet, classifying an email as spam or
            ham, classifying blog posts into different categories, automatic tagging
            of customer queries, and so on.</p>
